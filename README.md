## 🚀 About Me

Passionate about software engineering and clean architecture,  
I’m currently training as a Full-Stack Developer with a strong foundation in low-level programming (C) and backend development.

I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood — from memory management and system calls to REST APIs and dynamic front-end interfaces.

My goal: **build robust, scalable and well-structured web applications.**

# Featured Projects


## holbertonschool-hbnb — Airbnb Clone

**-> [holbertonschool-hbnb](https://github.com/Tommy-JOUHANS/holbertonschool-hbnb)**

### Hook

A simplified, full-stack replica of the Airbnb platform, developed progressively to master the architecture of a complete web application.

### Description

This project involves developing a functional clone of Airbnb, starting with a command-line version and culminating in a web application with a user interface.

It covers data model management (users, listings, bookings), data persistence (JSON files/database), and the creation of a dynamic web interface.

The project puts into practice:

- Object-oriented programming
- Database management
- Back-end development
- Front-end integration
- MVC architecture

### Objectives

- Understand the architecture of a complete web application
- Implement a storage engine (file and/or database)
- Develop a REST API
- Build a dynamic interface
- Apply best practices for project structuring

## holbertonschool-printf — Custom printf in C

**-> [holbertonschool-printf](https://github.com/Tommy-JOUHANS/holbertonschool-printf)**

### Hook

Custom implementation of the printf function in C, reproducing its standard behavior.

### Description

This project involves recreating the printf function from the standard C library (stdio.h).
It handles various format specifiers such as:

- %c (character)

- %s (string)
- %d / %i (integers)
- %u (unsigned integer)
- %x / %X (hexadecimal)
- %p (pointer)
- %% (%) symbol

The project involves:

- Pointer manipulation
- Variable argument handling (stdarg.h)
- String parsing
- Memory management
- Code modularization

### Objectives

- Understand the inner workings of standard functions
- Master variadic arguments
- Improve memory management in C
- Structure a collaborative project with multiple files and branches

##  holbertonschool-simple-shell — Mini Unix Shell

 **-> [holbertonschool-simple-shell](https://github.com/Thorgalix/holbertonschool-simple_shell)**


### Hook:

Development of a minimalist Unix shell interpreter in C.

### Description

This project consists of Create a simple shell capable of executing Unix commands such as:

- ls
- pwd
- echo Hello
- ./program

Main features:

- Reading user commands
- Creating processes with fork()
- Execution with execve()
- Managing environment variables
- Error handling
- Implementing some built-in commands
- It simulates the behavior of a classic Unix terminal.

### Objectives

- Understand process management under Linux
- Manipulate system calls
- Manage environment variables
- Implement a command interpreter
- Apply strict coding standards
